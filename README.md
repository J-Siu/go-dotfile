### Concept and Limitation

- Not a drop-in replacement of Stow.
- Only top level directories and files are dotted in target location (`DirDest`)
- Symlink directory is copied as normal directory
- Files removed from source, will not be deleted from target location
- Files that should keep out of go-dotfile management
  - `~/.ssh/known_hosts`
  - history files
  - cache files

### Install

Go install

```sh
go install github.com/J-Siu/go-dotfile@latest
```

Download

- https://github.com/J-Siu/go-dotfile/releases

### Build

```sh
git clone https://github.com/J-Siu/go-dotfile.git
```

This is build with go 1.24.5. If you have go < 1.24.5:

```sh
rm go.md go.sum
go mod init github.com/J-Siu/go-dotfile
go mod tidy
go get
```

Install

```sh
go install
```

### Configuration

Configuration must exist at `$HOME/.config/go-dotfile.json`, or supplied by the `-c` option.

Sample configuration:

```json
{
  "DirDest": "$HOME/tmp",
  "DirAP": [
    "$HOME/df_test/df_pub/append",
    "$HOME/df_test/df_pri/append"
  ],
  "DirCP": [
    "$HOME/df_test/df_pub/base",
    "$HOME/df_test/df_pri/base"
  ]
}
```

Variable|Default|Usage
--|--|--
DirDest|$HOME|Target location of dotfiles and directories
DirCP|n/a|Directories to be copied to target location
DirAP|n/a|Files in these directories will be be copied to target location if not already exist, else appended

### Testing

```sh
cp -r examples/df_test $HOME/
mkdir $HOME/tmp
go-dotfile -c examples/go-dotfile.sample.json
ls -a $HOME/tmp
```
